**Predicting Employee Attrition using LinkedIn Data**


**Overview:**

This project aims to predict employee attrition using data collected from LinkedIn profiles and companies. By analyzing various features extracted from LinkedIn profiles, such as user activity, education, and work history, we seek to develop a predictive model that can identify employees who are likely to leave their current position within the following year. The project utilizes machine learning algorithms and natural language processing techniques to process and analyze the LinkedIn data.

**Repository Contents:**

• databricks_notebook.ipynd: This directory contains Databricks notebooks that are specifically designed to be run in the Databricks environment. These notebooks utilize Databricks-specific features and configurations, and uses datasets given by Bright Data (Linkedin profiles and companies).

• final_project_notebook.ipynb: This Jupyter notebook is intended to be run in any Python environment that has Python 3.10. or above installed. It contains the final project code, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

**Installation Instructions:**

To run the notebooks in this repository, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

!pip install langchain

!pip install -q -U google-generativeai
